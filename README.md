# Order-Summary-Design
This project showcases an interactive order summary card featuring SVG backgrounds and a clean, modern design. I learned to integrate and position SVGs as background elements, ensuring proper layering with other components using z-index and positioning techniques. The design is responsive, optimized for different screen sizes.
